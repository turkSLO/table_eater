This app serves as utility for all statisticians and students of statistics. The user inputs a web page and the app scans the page for any tables. The app gives the option to preview the tables one by one. You are able to select specific tables from pages (allowing for multiple tables to be selected at once). After selecting your tables, you can download the tables in either CSV or TXT format.
